The taxonomy below consists of a subset of nodes from the C3 Taxonomy version 2.0 released on Nov 1, 2015. The tree have been extended with a *User defined* subtree describing nodes which have not yet been added to the C3 Taxonomy.

Each node in the tree is prefixed with a number describing the level of the node in the tree (i.e. the distance from the root node).

Each node is also postfixed with a tuple with three values, indicating:

* The number of times a *mandatory* standard references a node in the taxonomy
* The number of times a *candidate* standard references a node in the taxonomy
* The number of times a taxonomy node is referenced from a *service profile*
